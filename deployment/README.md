   - Git status check
   - Configuration validation

2. üöÑ Railway deployment
   - Upload to Railway
   - Wait for deployment completion
   - Get deployment URL

3. ‚úÖ Post-deployment verification
   - Service initialization wait
   - Comprehensive health checks
   - Performance validation

4. üéØ Finalization
   - Deployment summary
   - Info saving
   - Success reporting

### 4. Rollback Management (`rollback.js`)

Emergency rollback utility with multiple strategies.

**Features:**
- Interactive rollback selection
- Git-based rollback
- Deployment history analysis
- Automatic verification
- Safety confirmations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive rollback
npm run rollback

# Rollback to previous commit
node deployment/rollback.js --previous

# Rollback to specific commit
node deployment/rollback.js --commit abc1234

# Force rollback (skip confirmations)
node deployment/rollback.js --force --previous

# Rollback without verification
node deployment/rollback.js --no-verify --previous
```

**Rollback Options:**
1. Previous commit (HEAD~1)
2. Select from recent commits
3. Custom commit hash
4. Cancel operation

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk authentication secret

**Optional:**
- `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL` - Railway deployment URL (auto-detected)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (info, warn, error)
- `MAX_CONNECTIONS` - Maximum WebSocket connections
- `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` - Connection timeout in milliseconds

### Railway Configuration

Ensure these files exist in your project root:
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `Procfile` - Process definition
- `.railwayignore` - Deployment exclusions

### Package.json Scripts

Required scripts in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js",
    "deploy": "node deployment/deploy.js",
    "test": "node deployment/verify.js",
    "test:local": "node deployment/test-local.js",
    "rollback": "node deployment/rollback.js",
    "health": "curl $RAILWAY_STATIC_URL/health || echo 'Health check failed'"
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Pre-deployment Checks
- Railway CLI authentication
- Environment variable validation
- Local test execution
- Git repository status
- Configuration file verification

### Post-deployment Verification
- Health endpoint testing
- WebSocket functionality
- Database connectivity
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling validation

### Rollback Safety

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### Health Endpoints
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health/detailed` - Comprehensive service status
- `/health/database` - Database connectivity
- `/health/memory` - Memory usage
- `/metrics` - Performance metrics

### Logging
All deployment operations are logged with:
- Timestamps
- Step-by-step progress
- Error details
- Performance metrics
- Deployment summaries

### Deployment History
Deployment information is saved to `.railway-deployment.json`:
```json
{
  "version": "abc1234",
  "url": "https://your-app.railway.app",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T04:30:00.000Z",
  "duration": 45000,
  "success": true,
  "steps": [...]
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Railway CLI Not Found:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

**Environment Variables Missing:**
- Check `.env` file exists
- Verify all required variables are set
- Use `railway variables` to check Railway environment

**Deployment Timeout:**
- Check Railway build logs: `railway logs`
- Increase timeout: `--timeout 600000`
- Verify server starts correctly locally

**Health Checks Failing:**
- Check server logs: `railway logs`
- Verify database connectivity
- Test endpoints manually

**Rollback Issues:**
- Ensure git repository is clean
- Check Railway deployment history
- Verify target commit exists

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Railway status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Check domains
railway domains

# Test health locally
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test deployed health
curl $RAILWAY_STATIC_URL/health
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Deployment Speed
- Average deployment time: 2-5 minutes
- Pre-deployment checks: 30-60 seconds
- Railway upload: 1-2 minutes
- Service initialization: 30-60 seconds
- Post-deployment verification: 1-2 minutes

### Resource Usage
- Memory limit: 512MB (Railway free tier)
- CPU: Shared (Railway free tier)
- Build timeout: 10 minutes
- Runtime timeout: 30 seconds per request

### Optimization Tips
- Use `.railwayignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Minimize dependencies in `package.json`
- Use production NODE_ENV
- Enable compression for WebSocket connections
- Implement proper health checks

## üîí Security

### Best Practices
- Never commit secrets to git
- Use Railway environment variables
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Monitor for security issues

### Environment Security
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least-privilege access
- Monitor access logs
- Implement rate limiting
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
